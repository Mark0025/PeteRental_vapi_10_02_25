## Your Questions

### 1. "This app says rentals but it's not just for rentals, right?"

**CORRECT!** Your app is actually TWO systems in one:

1. **Property Management System** (Primary - Active)
   - Microsoft Calendar integration
   - Appointment booking via VAPI voice
   - get_availability and set_appointment functions
   - **This is what's working and being used**

2. **Rental Property Scraping** (Secondary - Dormant)
   - LangChain + Playwright scraper
   - DuckDuckGo search integration
   - Property listing extraction
   - **This exists but isn't actively integrated with VAPI**

### 2. "Do you have access to VAPI SDK?"

**YES and NO:**

- You do NOT currently have the VAPI Python SDK installed in your dependencies
- You ARE using VAPI via their REST API (webhook integration)
- VAPI has TWO Python SDKs available:
  - `vapi-server-sdk` (for backend API calls)
  - `client-sdk-python` (for client-side voice)

**Recommendation:** You should install `vapi-server-sdk` to manage agents programmatically:

```bash
uv add vapi-server-sdk
```

This would allow you to:
- Fetch all agents from your VAPI account
- Create/update agents programmatically
- Better integration than manual API calls

### 3. "We have one agent, need another following same pattern"

**CURRENT STATE:**
- ‚úÖ You have 1 agent: "Appointemt setter agent" (ID: 24464697-8f45-4b38-b43a-d337f50c370e)
- ‚úÖ Functions: get_availability, set_appointment
- ‚úÖ Working perfectly

**TO ADD ANOTHER AGENT:**

**Option A: Manual (via VAPI Dashboard)**
1. Go to dashboard.vapi.ai
2. Duplicate existing assistant
3. Change name/voice
4. Use SAME webhook URL
5. Use SAME functions

**Option B: Programmatic (Recommended)**
```python
# Install SDK first
from vapi_server import Vapi

vapi = Vapi(api_key=os.getenv("VAPI_API_KEY"))

# Clone existing assistant
new_agent = vapi.assistants.create(
    name="Property Manager 2",
    model={"model": "gpt-4o"},
    voice={"voiceId": "elliot"},
    serverUrl="https://peterentalvapi-latest.onrender.com/vapi/webhook",
    tools=[
        # Copy from vapi_calendar_functions.json
    ]
)
```

### 4. "Need ability to test any agent and organize appointments by agent"

**PROBLEM:** Currently NO way to distinguish which agent handled which call

**WHY:** Your webhook doesn't capture agent_id from VAPI

**SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE:**

```python
# main.py - Update webhook

@app.post("/vapi/webhook")
async def vapi_webhook(request: dict):
    # Extract agent info from VAPI
    assistant_id = request.get("assistant", {}).get("id")
    call_id = request.get("call", {}).get("id")

    # Store in database
    appointment = {
        "agent_id": assistant_id,
        "call_id": call_id,
        "property_address": ...,
        "attendee_name": ...,
        # ... other fields
    }

    # Save to new appointments table
    db.execute("INSERT INTO appointments ...")
```

**DATABASE SCHEMA NEEDED:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE agents (
    agent_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_name VARCHAR,
    vapi_assistant_id VARCHAR UNIQUE,
    calendar_user_id VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id VARCHAR REFERENCES agents(agent_id),
    vapi_call_id VARCHAR,
    property_address TEXT,
    start_time TIMESTAMP,
    attendee_name VARCHAR,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 5. "User session IDs and multiple users via email"

**CURRENT:** Hardcoded to `mark@peterei.com` or `pete_admin`

**NEEDED:** Email-based user system

**ARCHITECTURE:**

```python
# New user table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
    full_name VARCHAR,
    calendar_authorized BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

# Link users to agents
CREATE TABLE user_agents (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    agent_id VARCHAR REFERENCES agents(agent_id),
    role VARCHAR DEFAULT 'property_manager'
);
```

### 6. "Microsoft Calendar - we have it, analyze it"

**STATUS:** ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING

**WHAT YOU HAVE:**
- OAuth 2.0 flow complete
- Token storage in PostgreSQL
- Auto-refresh working
- 64 available slots found
- Appointment creation working
- Email invitations sent

**LIMITATIONS:**
- Only ONE calendar connected (mark@peterei.com)
- All agents use SAME calendar
- No multi-calendar support

**TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE USERS:**
Each user needs to:
1. Go to `/calendar/setup`
2. Enter their email
3. Authorize their Microsoft Calendar
4. Link to an agent

### 7. "Some pages look duplicated"

**DUPLICATES FOUND:**

1. **Two Calendar Classes**
   - `MicrosoftCalendar` ‚úÖ (Production - Microsoft Graph API)
   - `SimpleCalendar` ‚ö†Ô∏è (Testing only - JSON file)
   - **Action:** Keep both, document usage clearly

2. **Two Architecture Docs**
   - `/ARCHITECTURE.md` (old)
   - `/DEV_MAN/ARCHITECTURE.md` (newer)
   - **Action:** Consolidate to DEV_MAN/

3. **Deprecated Code**
   - `_deprecated/` folder has old VAPI router
   - **Action:** Can delete safely

4. **Multiple "What's Working" Docs**
   - WHATS_WORKING.md
   - whatsworking.py
   - **Action:** Keep one source of truth

   vapi = Vapi(api_key="d180ee70-5c20-4d9a-af4f-97f9e1d8957d")
   agents = vapi.assistants.list()
   print(f"You have {len(agents)} agents")
   ```

   ```

3. **Build Agent Registry**
   - List all VAPI agents
   - Link to calendar user_id
   - Track appointments per agent

### Next 2 Weeks

1. **Multi-User Support**
   - User table with emails
   - OAuth flow per user

## Questions for You

1. **How many agents do you want to support?**
   - 2-3 for testing?
   - 10+ production agents?

2. **Should each agent have their own calendar?**
   - Or share one calendar?

3. **Do you want users to self-register?**
   - Or admin-only user creation?

4. **Priority?**
   - Multi-agent ASAP
   - Or improve current agent first
