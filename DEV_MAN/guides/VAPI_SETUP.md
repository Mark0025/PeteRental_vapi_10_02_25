  "properties": {

      "description": "Property manager user ID (use 'pete_admin')",
      "default": "pete_admin"
    },
    "property_address": {
      "type": "string",

    }
  },

}
```

- "Can you book me for Monday at 10 AM?"

## üéØ Assistant Prompt Enhancement

Add this to your VAPI assistant's system prompt:

```
You are a helpful property rental assistant. You can:

1. Search for available rental properties on property management websites
2. Check the property manager's calendar for available viewing times
3. Book property viewing appointments

When a caller expresses interest in viewing a property:
1. First, use get_availability to check available time slots
2. Present 3-5 available times to the caller
3. Once they choose a time, use set_appointment to book it
4. Collect their name and email for the booking
5. Confirm the appointment details

Always be friendly and professional. The property manager's calendar is connected to Microsoft Calendar.
```

## üåê Production Deployment

### Current Setup:
- ‚úÖ Calendar connected (pete_admin)
- ‚úÖ Server running locally
- ‚úÖ Functions ready at `/vapi/webhook`

### For Production:
1. Your Render deployment is already configured at:
   `https://peterentalvapi-latest.onrender.com`

2. Update your production `.env` on Render:
   - Add all Microsoft credentials
   - Set `MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI=https://peterentalvapi-latest.onrender.com/calendar/auth/callback`

3. Re-authorize on production:
   - Visit: `https://peterentalvapi-latest.onrender.com/calendar/setup`
   - Complete OAuth flow

4. Update VAPI webhook URL to production:
   `https://peterentalvapi-latest.onrender.com/vapi/webhook`

**Assistant:** "Great! Can I get your name and email for the booking?"

**Caller:** "John Doe, john@example.com"

**Assistant:** Calls `set_appointment` ‚Üí "Perfect! I've booked your viewing for Monday at 2 PM. You'll receive a calendar invitation at john@example.com shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
